Similarities:
* Encapsulation - Shadow DOM, enforced HTTP boundaries
* Reusability/configurability - Ties into standard HTTP/CSS infrastructure
* Evolvability - imports and dep resolution infrastructure
* Built on a common medium - HTTP/HTML
* Clearly defined interfaces and interactions

Narrative:
MS/WC = Encapsulation & Common Media
Encapsulation + Common Media = Evolvability

Evolvability = Polyglot architectures, disposable everything (devops), agility, layering
