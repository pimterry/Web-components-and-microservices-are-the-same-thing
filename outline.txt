Similarities:
* Encapsulation - Shadow DOM, enforced HTTP boundaries
* Reusability/configurability - Ties into standard HTTP/CSS infrastructure
* Evolvability - imports and dep resolution infrastructure
* Built on a common medium - HTTP/HTML
* Clearly defined interfaces and interactions

Narrative:
MS/WC = Encapsulation & Common Media
Encapsulation + Common Media = Evolvability

Evolvability = Polyglot architectures, disposable everything (devops), agility, layering

Talk structure:
Web components:
* Templates
* HTML Imports
* Shadow DOM
* Custom elements
* Example
* This sounds like a tool, but really a set of patterns
Microservices:
* Monoliths
* Structure and patterns
* Example
Both:
* Encapsulation!
* Common medium!
* = EVOLVABILITY
* = Polyglot everything, disposable everything = agility agility agility
